Problem Statement : 

"Event_Management_System"

Problem Statment :

Full Stack Developer profile: 


Create a web application with the following functionalities:

User can login using gmail & create an event with the basic details such as eventname, start time, end time, location, description, category & banner. 

Create a listing page where we can see all the events and filter by date, city & category. 

Use case to test: 

When we select a date, it should list all the events that are starting on that date, ending on that date or events that are going on for that date. 

Add filters like ecommerce websites for categories & cities based on the date you have: 

Example: 

Filter by City:

Ahmedabad (20)

Gandhinagar (4) 

Vadodara (15)

Filter by Category; 

Music (15)

Business (10)

Exhibition (3)

Display the event listing using vue js 



Notes: 

Use PHP & MySQL at back end

Use React / Angular or Vue js at front end 

Use Google Login 

Make sure all the requests are through REST APIs 

Make sure your database & queries perform well for 100K + records. 

Let me know when you can submit this, so we can set the deadline accordingly
